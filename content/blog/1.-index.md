# The idea behind this site

Working with Nuxt eventually leads you to discovering a lot of things.

This website works as a place for me to do the following: 
- Log progress of my work and growth.
- Write down my notes, tips and tricks for everything related to software/web development.
- Eventually write my thoughts on the Blog section. 
- Write Documentation for my projects for my clients to read.
